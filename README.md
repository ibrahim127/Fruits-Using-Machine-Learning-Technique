# Fruits-Using-Machine-Learning-Technique
The food processing industry has been working with different kind of fruits. Most of the industries who are classifying the classes and the damages of fruit are manual. As a result of manual classification, it will become a challenging task for human as it is costly and time consuming. So, in this research work, we have proposed a method with a machine learning technique that classify various kinds of fruits and detect damage automatically. We have used seven machine learning algorithms for validating our proposed method and k-mean and graph-cut segmentation technique to detect damage on fruit image.
